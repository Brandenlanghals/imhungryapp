# I'm Hungry

**[Try it out here!](https://brandenlanghals.github.io/imhungryapp/index.html)**

This app was created to solve the question of "What should I eat today?" Users can select a cuisine type and using Spoonacular API a meal suggestion is generated. The meal includes ingredients, cook-time, and a video of how to prepare the meal. A button to purchase a suggested wine from Amazon is also a feature.

## Future Updates
App is already mobile responsive, but we would like to launch it to the app store and monetize it using advertising. We would like to allow companies to promote their ingredients and show you where to buy them.
